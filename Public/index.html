               <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
               <p>Sending and receiving data is energy-intensive. It needs processing power, which uses electricity and produces heat. Sadly, most of the electricity used to power the internet comes from fossil fuels, not renewables.</p>
               <h2>Page Weight</h2>
               <p>There are over 1.13 billion websites online! The data transmitted between your website and the user’s device travels through the internet, which requires energy. And with web pages averaging over 2MB, that’s a ton of data traveling the internet.</p>
               <h2>Page Speed</h2>
               <p>A slow loading website consumes more energy and produces more emissions. Every time a visitor comes to your site, it requires a lot of processing power, putting a physical strain on your server and increasing e-waste.</p>

         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">What is a website's carbon footprint?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A website's carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), produced during its operation. This includes the energy used to host, deliver, and maintain the website, as well as the emissions associated with user interactions such as data transfer and device energy consumption.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">How does using websites contribute to carbon emissions?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Websites require servers to host their data, which consume electricity, usually generated from fossil fuels, leading to carbon emissions. Additionally, every time a user accesses a website, data is transferred across networks, requiring energy and generating emissions, especially if the user's device is energy-intensive.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Can we reduce the carbon footprint of websites?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Yes, there are various strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of websites. These include using energy-efficient servers and data centers, optimizing website code and content for faster loading times and reduced data transfer, implementing caching mechanisms to minimize server requests, and using renewable energy sources to power servers.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">What is a sustainable website?</h3>
            <p class="answer">A sustainable website is one that is designed and developed with the environment in mind, minimizing its impact on natural resources and reducing its carbon footprint. This includes practices such as using renewable energy sources and optimizing website performance.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">What is green hosting?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Green hosting is web hosting that uses renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power to power their servers, reducing their carbon footprint. Some green hosting companies also engage in sustainable practices such as recycling and reducing waste.</p>
